# Decentralized_Identity_Management_System
A C-based application for managing decentralized identities using the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) with encryption for security.
# Decentralized Identity Management System (DIMS)

## Overview

The Decentralized Identity Management System (DIMS) is a C-based application designed to manage and verify user identities on a decentralized network using the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). The system ensures secure and efficient management of digital identities, leveraging the principles of Web 3.0 to provide enhanced privacy and security.

## Features

- **Identity Creation and Management:** Users can create decentralized identities that are securely stored and managed.
- **Encryption:** The system uses AES encryption to protect sensitive data.
- **Decentralized Storage:** Identity data is distributed across the ICP network, ensuring data integrity and security.
- **Access Control:** Users have the ability to control who can access their identity information.
- **Verification:** The system provides tools for verifying identities without exposing sensitive data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- GCC or Clang (for compiling C code)
- OpenSSL library (for cryptographic functions)
- ICP SDK (for integrating with the Internet Computer Protocol)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CH-Anonymous/Decentralized_Identity_Management_System.git
   cd Decentralized_Identity_Management_System
